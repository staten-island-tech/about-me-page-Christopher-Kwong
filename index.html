    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Information</h2>
    <p>My name is Christopher Kwong and I'm a sophomore at Staten Island Technical High School. I don't do anything that stands out compared to others. My normal day consists of going to school, going home, eating, doing work, playing video games, and finally, ending the day with sleeping. Occasionally, I would go out and take a walk in the park or go shopping for neccesities.</p>
